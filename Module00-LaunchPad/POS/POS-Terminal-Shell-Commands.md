# 🧩 Proof-of-Skill: Terminal & Shell Commands  
*(Module 00 — Launch Pad, AI Product Systems Roadmap)*

👋 Welcome!  
If you’re reading this file, you’re looking at one of my **Proof-of-Skill (POS) projects**.  
Each POS demonstrates not just that I studied something — but that I practiced it, documented it, and turned it into a **portfolio-ready artifact**.  

This POS comes from **Module 00 — Launch Pad**, and it covers my work with **Terminal/Shell commands**.  
I applied the Pareto Principle (20% of commands for 80% of the value) and practiced them in a live environment.

## 🖥️ Project Summary
I created a **Terminal/Shell Commands Demo Project** to practice, record, and share the essential commands I learned.  
- The session was recorded as a **demo GIF/MP4** and published publicly.  
- The project has its own dedicated GitHub repo:  
  👉 [Terminal Project Repository](https://github.com/monica-ai001/terminal-project)  
- This project shows I can **navigate, manage files, edit content, and control processes** directly from the shell — the foundation for real-world development.  

👉 You can also see the published demo here:

## 🔑 Commands Practiced (Pareto 20%)
- **Navigation & Directories**
  - `pwd` → print current directory  
  - `ls -l, -a, -h` → list files (details, hidden, human-readable)  
  - `cd` → change directories  
  - `mkdir`, `rmdir` → create/remove directories  

- **File Management**
  - `touch` → create empty files  
  - `cp -r` → copy files/folders (recursive)  
  - `mv` → move/rename files  
  - `rm -i` → safely remove files (interactive prompt)  

- **Viewing & Editing Files**
  - `cat` → print file contents  
  - `head`, `tail` → preview top/bottom lines  
  - `less` → scroll through a file  
  - `nano` → quick edits inside terminal  

- **Permissions & Ownership**
  - `chmod +x` → make scripts executable  
  - `chown` → change file ownership  

- **Processes**
  - `ps` → list running processes  
  - `top` → live system monitoring  
  - `kill` → stop a process by PID  

- **Redirection & Execution**
  - `>>` → append output to file  
  - `<` → use file as input  
  - `chmod +x script.sh && ./script.sh` → run shell scripts  

---

## 🌟 Skills Demonstrated
- Used **basic navigation** to move through directories.  
- Managed files and folders entirely via command line.  
- Edited text without a GUI (using `nano`).  
- Practiced **safe deletion** (`rm -i`) and permission changes (`chmod`).  
- Learned **process management** (`ps`, `top`, `kill`).  
- Executed and chained shell scripts.  
- Captured and shared a **professional project demo** (GIF + LinkedIn post).  
- Published a **dedicated repo** on GitHub to document and showcase the project.

## 🎯 Why It Matters
Terminal fluency is essential in real-world development.  
This POS shows I can:  
- Work productively without relying on GUIs.  
- Use the 20% of commands that give 80% of the value.  
- Document, share, and present technical work in a professional format.  
- Build, publish, and share projects publicly on **GitHub and LinkedIn**.

## 📌 Status
**POS Complete** — Demo project published on LinkedIn, repo available on GitHub, and Module 00 now has its first completed artifact.  
Next step: build on this foundation by using the terminal in Git, Python, and deployment workflows.
