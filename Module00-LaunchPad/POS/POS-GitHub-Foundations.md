# 🧩 Proof-of-Skill: Git & GitHub Foundations  
*(Module 00 — Launch Pad, AI Product Systems Roadmap)*

👋 Welcome!  
If you’re reading this file, you’re looking at one of my **Proof-of-Skill (POS) projects**.  
Each module in my AI Product Systems roadmap includes POS files like this one.  
They are designed to demonstrate not just that I studied something — but that I practiced it, documented it, and turned it into a **portfolio-ready artifact**.  

This POS comes from **Module 00 — Launch Pad**, and it covers my work in **Git & GitHub Foundations**.  
It ties together DataCamp certifications, GitHub’s own tutorials, and my real-world repo scaffolding process.

## 🏗️ What Did I Do Here?
I built a **scaffolding inside GitHub**.  

In software development, *scaffolding* means creating the **initial folder and file structure** of a project before filling it in with detailed content.  
Think of it like building a skyscraper:  
- The steel beams and scaffolding come first.  
- The walls, windows, and furniture get added later.  

In this repo, scaffolding =  
- Creating the **module folders** (00–10 + Roadmaps).  
- Adding placeholder `README.md` files in each.  
- Preparing the structure so future code, dashboards, and apps have a home.  

This way, the repo is already professional and navigable, even before projects are added.  

You can see the scaffolding for yourself here:

## 📚 Learning Inputs
- Completed **DataCamp’s GitHub Foundations skill track**  
- Earned four **Git & GitHub certifications** on DataCamp  
- Practiced with **GitHub’s own tutorials** (Hello World repo, branching, issues, PRs)  
- Applied lessons in **Visual Studio Code with GitHub integration**

## 🔨 Actions & Skills Demonstrated in This POS

### 🗂️ Repository Initialization & Setup
- Created a new repo on GitHub with **README**, Python `.gitignore`, and **MIT License**.  
- Defined a professional repo description and identity.  

### 🌿 Branching & Workflow Discipline
- Created a feature branch (`feature/scaffolding`) instead of working directly on `main`.  
- Practiced **branch switching** and syncing between local VS Code and remote GitHub.  
- Followed professional naming conventions (`feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`).  

### 🏗️ Scaffolding Structure
- Built an **11-folder structure** (Modules 00–10 + Roadmaps).  
- Added placeholder `README.md` files in each module for documentation consistency.  
- **Zero-padded folder names** (00–10) for logical sorting in GitHub/VS Code.  
- Created a `Master-Roadmap.md` as the foundation for high-level planning.  

### 📂 File & Folder Management
- Practiced folder creation and renaming via **GitHub.com** and **VS Code’s integrated terminal**.  
- Used `mv`, `ls`, and `pwd` commands in the terminal to verify structure and rename modules.  

### 📝 Commit Hygiene
- Grouped related changes into single commits instead of many small commits.  
- Corrected messy history by **squashing commits** into one clean, professional commit.  
- Practiced `git commit --amend` to rewrite accidental or missing commit messages.  

### 🔀 Pull Request & Review
- Opened a **Pull Request** from `feature/scaffolding` to `main`.  
- Wrote a professional PR title and description (*Summary, Why, Next Steps*).  
- Reviewed changes visually in GitHub before merging.  

### ✅ Merging & Release Discipline
- Merged changes using **Squash and Merge** → left `main` with one clean commit.  
- Tagged a release (`v0.0`) with notes: *Scaffolding Complete*.  
- Practiced **semantic versioning** from day one (`v0.0` = structural milestone).  

### 🖥️ VS Code Integration
- Used VS Code’s **Source Control panel** for staging, committing, and pushing.  
- Practiced both **GUI actions** (commit button, sync) and **terminal commands** (`git add .`, `git push origin`).  
- Explored the difference between **commit**, **push**, **fetch**, and **pull**.  

### 🧹 Professional Repo Hygiene
- Applied `.gitignore` to keep junk files (caches, venvs, checkpoints) out of version control.  
- Standardized **folder naming conventions** for clarity and portability.  
- Deleted temporary or placeholder branches after merge to keep repo tidy.

## 🎯 Why It Matters
This isn’t just empty folders.  
It’s a demonstration of **real-world GitHub workflow discipline**:  
- Certificates earned → applied directly in a live repo.  
- Tutorials completed → embedded into professional practice.  
- Repo scaffold → foundation for all future AI Product Systems modules.

## 📌 Status
**POS Complete** — Scaffolding built, commits cleaned, merged into `main`, and tagged `v0.0`.  
Each module folder will now expand with detailed roadmaps, projects, and artifacts as I progress.
