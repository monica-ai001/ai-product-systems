# Module 0 — Launch Pad 🚀

**Theme:** Environment, Tools, and Identity Setup  

This module is all about preparing my toolchain and proving I can already use each tool once.  
It sets the foundation for all future modules in the AI Product Systems roadmap.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Install and configure core tools: Python, Git, GitHub, VS Code, Anaconda, Jupyter, matplotlib, Flutter, Figma, Trello, GitHub Copilot.  
- Use each tool at least once to confirm setup.  
- Begin establishing professional identity (GitHub profile README, LinkedIn headline update).  
- Track progress using Trello and maintain roadmaps in the repo.  
- Lay the groundwork for future modules in **data, applied AI/ML, cloud platforms, and app development**.

## 🪛 Structure

This module folder contains:  
- **Module0-LaunchPad-Roadmap.md** → detailed learning roadmap for this module.  
- **README.md** → this overview of goals, structure, and POS’s.  
- (Later) subfolders and artifacts for completed POS projects:  
  - **Notebook/** → Jupyter notebook + matplotlib chart.  
  - **Flutter-App/** → simple app with screenshot proof.  
  - **Figma/** → wireframe export.  
  - **Trello/** → screenshot of Module 0 board.  
  - **Identity/** → GitHub profile README + LinkedIn screenshot.  
  - **Notes/** → setup checklist.  
  - **Terminal/** → terminal command project (GIFs, scripts, README).

- Commit/branch/PR/release proof.  
- Artifact: this **ai-product-systems** repo structure itself.  

### 3. Mini Data Story POS (planned 🎯)  
- Small dataset → e.g., *Triggers vs Confusion Spikes*.  
- Jupyter notebook + matplotlib chart.  
- Chart displayed in a simple Flutter app.  
- Figma wireframe of a dashboard.  
- Trello board screenshot as workflow proof.  
- Identity artifacts: GitHub profile README, LinkedIn update.
