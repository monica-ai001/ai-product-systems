# AI Product Systems 🚀

This repository documents my end-to-end journey through the **AI Product Systems roadmap**.  
It contains all 10 modules of my program, each with its own roadmap, README,  
and proof-of-skill (POS) projects.

---

## 📊 What is AI Product Systems?
**AI Product Systems** is a hybrid learning path I designed to master:
- Data & Statistics  
- Applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML)  
- Cloud Platforms & APIs  
- No/Low-Code AI Solutions  
- Native Mobile Development  
- UX, Compliance & Monetization  
- Portfolio & Thought Leadership  

The goal: build and launch intelligent products (apps, SaaS, dashboards, automations)  
while creating a public portfolio that proves my skills to employers and clients.

## 🪛 Repository Structure

The repo is organized into **10 module folders** plus a Roadmaps folder:

- **Roadmaps/** → contains the *Master Roadmap* (big picture plan).  
- **Module0-LaunchPad/** → toolchain setup, environment configuration, and early POS’s.  
- **Module1-Programming/** → Python foundations, CLI tools, and first mobile app.  
- **Module2-Data-Wrangling/** → Pandas, SQL, first AI apps (Streamlit/Bubble).  
- **Module3-Math-Stats/** → probability, statistics, and simulations.  
- **Module4-Applied-Stats-Automation/** → hypothesis testing, A/B tests, and automations (Zapier/Make).  
- **Module5-ML-Foundations/** → regression, first ML models, and SaaS MVP with Stripe.  
- **Module6-Professional-Certification/** → certification prep and consulting package.  
- **Module7-Advanced-ML-APIs/** → Kaggle projects, ML APIs, and AI chat apps.  
- **Module8-Deep-Learning-Storytelling/** → CNNs, transformers, dashboards with Tableau/Power BI.  
- **Module9-Product-Studio/** → compliance, monetization, and building a full AI product.  
- **Module10-Portfolio/** → portfolio polish, GitHub showcase, and publishing apps.  

Each module folder includes:  
- `README.md` → overview of the module’s goals and planned POS’s.  
- `ModuleX-Roadmap.md` → detailed learning roadmap.  
- (Later) subfolders for **POS projects and artifacts**.

## 📚 Learning Platforms
Throughout the roadmap, I use a mix of platforms for structured learning, practice, and certifications:

- **DataCamp** → data science & Python courses  
- **Codecademy** → programming and certificate tracks  
- **LinkedIn Learning** → coding practice & certificates  
- **Coursera** → applied AI/ML & cloud certifications  
- **Khan Academy & Brilliant** → math and statistics foundations  
- **IXL** → adaptive math practice for skill reinforcement  
- **Quizlet** → flashcards for spaced repetition and recall  
- **ChatGPT Plus** → AI-powered tutoring, coding help, and brainstorming  

These complement project-based learning in GitHub, Figma, Flutter, Trello, and other tools.
