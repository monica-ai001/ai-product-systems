# Module 0 — Launch Pad 🚀

**Theme:** Environment, Tools, and Identity Setup  

This module is all about preparing my toolchain, setting up workflows, and proving I can already use each tool once.  
It establishes the foundation for all future modules in the AI Product Systems roadmap.  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Create accounts and platforms (GitHub, DataCamp, Codecademy, LinkedIn Learning, ChatGPT, Coursera, Khan Academy, Brilliant, Trello, Notion, Figma, Flutter).  
- Install and configure the core development environment (Anaconda, VS Code, GitHub Copilot, Jupyter).  
- Set up mobile development (Flutter SDK, Android Studio, Xcode if Mac).  
- Establish workflows and knowledge systems (Trello, Notion/Quizlet, Google Drive, Figma).  
- Begin personal identity and branding (niche identity, LinkedIn headline, GitHub profile README).  
- Configure quality-of-life tools (GitHub Desktop, Postman, Slack/Discord, Obsidian, backups).

- ⭐ Install VS Code (Python, Jupyter, GitHub Copilot extensions).  
- Configure GitHub Copilot in VS Code.  
- Set up Jupyter Notebooks in Anaconda.  
- Run and save first “Hello World” notebook in Jupyter.  
- ⭐ Create GitHub repo: `ai-product-systems` → push Hello World notebook.  

### Module 0.3 — Mobile Development Setup
- ⭐ Install Flutter SDK.  
- ⭐ Install Android Studio (with emulator).  
- (If Mac) Install Xcode (for iOS builds).  
- Run `flutter doctor` to check dependencies.  
- Create first “Hello World” Flutter app.  
- ⭐ Run app in emulator and save screenshot.  
- Optional: Push Flutter Hello World to GitHub.  

### Module 0.4 — Workflow & Knowledge Systems
- Create folder system for projects (Data, AI, Mobile, SaaS).  
- Link GitHub repo structure to Trello (GitHub issues integration).  
- Create Google Drive/Dropbox backup folder.  
- Install Quizlet (or Notion DB) for flashcards.

- Create Figma project → simple dashboard wireframe.  
- Optional: Integrate Trello + GitHub + Notion.  

### Module 0.5 — Personal Identity & Branding
- Write one-sentence niche identity:  
  *“Building AI Product Systems: apps, dashboards, and mobile tools powered by AI + data.”*  
- Create LinkedIn headline:  
  *“AI Product Systems | Data + AI + No-Code + Mobile.”*  
- Update GitHub profile README (bio, roadmap link, goals). ⭐  
- Optional: Reserve domain name for portfolio site.  
- ⭐ LinkedIn proof-of-skill post: screenshot of Jupyter Hello World + Flutter Hello World → announce journey start.  

### Module 0.6 — Quality-of-Life Setup
- Install GitHub Desktop (optional GUI).  
- Install Postman (for API testing).  
- Set up Slack/Discord account for AI/data dev communities.  
- Install Obsidian or Notion mobile app.  
- Configure backup system (Google Drive/local).

## 🧩 Proof-of-Skill (POS)

### 1. Terminal / Shell Commands POS ✅  
- Delivered a **professional walkthrough project** showcasing the 20% of terminal commands that drive 80% of daily developer workflows.  
- Captured demo as GIF/MP4 and committed to GitHub with clear documentation.  
- Published on LinkedIn as a visual micro-tutorial → positioned as both technical skill and thought-leadership artifact.  

### 2. GitHub Scaffolding POS 🚧  
- Created a **multi-module repository architecture** with 10 modules, roadmaps, and READMEs to mirror professional project structure.  
- Demonstrated **branching, PR, and release workflow** → version-controlled like a real development team.  
- Published initial **`v0.0` release** on GitHub → portfolio-ready artifact that shows professional repo practices.  

### 3. Mini Data Story POS (planned 🎯)  
- Built a **small but compelling dataset** (Triggers vs Confusion Spikes) relevant to dementia-care workflows.  
- Visualized findings in Jupyter with matplotlib, then **integrated into a Flutter app** to demonstrate cross-tool capability.  
- Designed a **Figma wireframe dashboard** for how such insights could appear in a real-world app.  
- Tracked and documented work via Trello → proof of professional workflow discipline.  
- Shared as a **story-driven case study** → “From dataset → chart → app → design” in one narrative.
